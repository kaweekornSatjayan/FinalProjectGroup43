[x] Create .gitignore file.

[x] Set up project folder structure (backend, frontend).

[x] Connect local repository to GitHub Desktop correctly.

[x] 2. Database Schema (Model)

[x] Design and create the noteModel.js.

[x] 3. Application Logic (Controller)

[x] Design and create the noteController.js.

[x] Implement CRUD and LLM functions.

[x] 4. API Endpoints (Routes)

[x] Design and create the noteRoute.js.

[x] 5. Server Configuration

[x] Create config/db.js, app.js, and server.js.

[x] 6. Environment & Security

[x] Create .env file for secret keys.

[x] 7. Version Control

[x] Make first push to main branch on GitHub. (Completed)

Phase 2: Frontend Development (Next Steps)
Now that the backend is live on GitHub, you and your friend can start building the user interface.

[ ] 1. Setup Frontend Framework

[ ] Choose a framework: Decide as a team if you will use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML/CSS/JS.

[ ] Initialize the project: Use the framework's command-line tool to create the project inside the frontend folder (e.g., npx create-react-app . if you are already inside the frontend folder).

[ ] 2. Build UI Components

[ ] NoteList.js: A component to display all notes fetched from the backend.

[ ] NoteView.js: A component to show the full content of a single selected note.

[ ] NoteEditor.js: A form for creating a new note or editing an existing one.

[ ] ActionButtons.js: A component containing the buttons for "Delete", "Summarize", "Generate Title", and "Elaborate".

[ ] 3. Connect to Backend API

[ ] Create a service file (e.g., api.js) to hold all the fetch or axios calls to your backend API endpoints.

[ ] Connect the UI components to these service functions to display data and send updates.

[ ] 4. State Management

[ ] Decide how to manage the application's data. For simple apps, React's useState and useContext are often enough.
